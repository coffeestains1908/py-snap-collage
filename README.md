# py-snap-collage
Small application that works like Window's snipping tool but can compile multiple images into one collage

There are many more things needed to be done:
* Positioning images in PyQt
* Clear images
* Take screenshot of second monitor is blank [Need fix]
* Copy image to clipboard
* Save image
